## What is this & how do I use it?

This is a client for obsidian, that can connect to it.
The core interaction with obsidian is via [obsidian-local-rest-api](https://github.com/coddingtonbear/obsidian-local-rest-api)

You install the extension and pass the creds to
```shell
NOOBGAM_OBISIDIAN_PORT=27103
NOOBGAM_OBSIDIAN_TOKEN=43278eryu329dj2398d327e82
```
